##**How To Play**
The following are the instructions on how to play the game

* When you **open** the game you will see a _boy character_ at the bottom center of the window.. which represents the **player** character and also four **enemy** characters moving with the intention of attacking the player character when he enters the area.
* **Press** the **Up** key on the keyboard to make the player character  move upwards, **Down** key to move the player character downwards, **Left** key to move the player leftwards and the **Right** key to move rightwards. _Navigate_ in such a way that you **dont crash** into any of the **enemy characters**.
* The game has three areas: namely the **grass area** which is your safe area.. **Enemies** wont attack you here. The **second area** is the **stone area** where the **enemies will move with varying speeds** horizontally with the intention of _attacking_ you. The **third area** is the **water area** which is your **ultimate goal** or destination.
* The **main goal** of the player is to escape all the enemies and reach the water successfully.
* However, the player has to reach the water **three times in a row** to complete the game.
* This means that if the player **collides** with the enemy character in between, he will have to start again.
* You have successfully completed the game when you see the **'Congratulations!! You did it!!'** message on the screen.
